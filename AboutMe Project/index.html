		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi everyone! My name is Andrew Brown and I am a current High School senior in Richmond, VA. I love music and play several instruments (guitar, trumpet, drums). Music is a great way for me to relax and forget about the stress of this crazy world! Some of my favorite things to do are go on bike rides, go on hikes, and hang out with friends. I spend a lot of time online and am fascinated by all things technical! For a while, I was very interested in theater design and production. Once the pandemic hit, however, I sought a more viable career. I found myself watching tons of YouTube videos on programming and was fascinated in my APCS class this fall. I decided to search for a more computer-orientated major in college and found the NYU <abbr title="Interactive Media Arts">IMA</abbr> program. In this program, I will have the opportunity to take programming and technical classes, as well as very artistic ones. The prefect combination for my interests! I am very much looking forward to my time in New York as well!</p>

		<h2>Why this Site?</h2>
		<p>I am creating this site as a test for a course I am taking in HTML5. This site will server as a sort of "portfolio," containing a collection of projects I have made/worked on and things I like right now! Currently, the site is very bare bones and only made in HTML5, as I do not know any CSS or JS. I hope to come back and improve the framework and look of this project later on down the road! Check back soon for updates!<br>The entirety of this site was made with the very basic HTML5 tags I know, I hope you enjoy!</p>
